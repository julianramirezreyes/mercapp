   Explanation for issues of type "AndroidGradlePluginVersion":
   This detector looks for usage of the Android Gradle Plugin where the
   version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older
   versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick
   with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more
   recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using

   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is

             ~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "NewerVersionAvailable":
   This detector checks with a central repository to see if there are newer
   versions available for the dependencies used by this project. This is
   similar to the GradleDependency check, which checks for newer versions
   available in the Android SDK tools and libraries, but this works with any
   MavenCentral dependency, and connects to the library every time, which
   makes it more flexible but also much slower.

/home/julian/proyectos/kotlin/mercapp/composeApp/src/androidMain/res/drawable-v24: Warning: This folder configuration (v24) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 24. Merge all the resources in this folder into drawable. [ObsoleteSdkInt]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

/home/julian/proyectos/kotlin/mercapp/composeApp/src/androidMain/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: Warning: The resource R.mipmap.ic_launcher_round appears to be unused [UnusedResources]

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.
   ,

   Available options:

   **skip-libraries** (default is true):
   Whether the unused resource check should skip reporting unused resources in libraries.

   Many libraries will declare resources that are part of the library surface; other modules depending on the library will also reference the resources. To avoid reporting all these resources as unused (in the context of a library), the unused resource check normally skips reporting unused resources in libraries. Instead, run the unused resource check on the consuming app module (along with `checkDependencies=true`).

   However, there are cases where you want to check that all the resources declared in a library are used; in that case, you can disable the skip option.

   To configure this option, use a `lint.xml` file with an <option> like this:

   ```xml
   <lint>
       <issue id="UnusedResources">
           <option name="skip-libraries" value="true" />
       </issue>
   </lint>
   ```

/home/julian/proyectos/kotlin/mercapp/composeApp/src/androidMain/res/drawable-nodpi/ic_mercapp.png: Warning: Launcher icon used as round icon did not have a circular shape [IconLauncherShape]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLauncherShape":
   According to the Android Design Guide
   (https://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/designer/material/iconography) your
   launcher icons should "use a distinct silhouette", a "three-dimensional,
   front view, with a slight perspective as if viewed from above, so that
   users perceive some depth."

   The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a
   filled square.
